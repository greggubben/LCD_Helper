Simple Arduino program to help manage displaying values on an LCD display. It can be used to place labels once and then refresh only the pertinent stats on a regular frequency.

To install this code follow the instructions at: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

Alternately you can manually place this code in the libraries directory where you store your sketches. The directory should look like the following:
```
<sketches location>/libaries/
    LCD_Helper/
        LCD_Helper.cpp
        LCD_Helper.h
        examples/TestDisplay/
            TestDisplay.ino
```
If you use the zip file from the right menu, I would suggest renaming the directory after it is installed to remove the "-master" that is added by GitHub.

If you prefer not to install the libraries you can place the *LCD_Helper.cpp* and *LCD_Helper.h* files in your sketch directory.
